## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the power of data visualization and real-time analytics in understanding and improving sales performance.  The dashboard provides actionable insights into Blinkit's sales data (simulated), enabling data-driven decision-making.
The dashboard is organized into several key sections, each designed to provide specific insights:

1. **Top Header:** Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating. This provides a high-level snapshot of overall performance.

2. **Outlet Establishment (Line Chart):**  Visualizes the sales trend over time, allowing for the identification of growth patterns, seasonality, and the impact of external factors on sales.

3. **Filter Panel:** Enables interactive filtering of the data by Outlet Location Type (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3), Outlet Size (Small, Medium, High), and Item Type (various food categories). This allows for granular analysis of specific segments.

4. **Fat Content and Item Type (Bar Charts):**  Show the distribution of sales based on fat content (Low Fat, Regular) and the sales contribution of different item categories.  This helps understand customer preferences and product popularity.

5. **Outlet Location (Map) and Outlet Size (Donut Chart):** The map visually represents sales distribution across different locations, while the donut chart shows the proportion of sales from various outlet sizes. This provides geographical and structural insights into sales performance.

6. **Outlet Type (Table):**  Provides a detailed breakdown of performance metrics (Total Sales, Number of Items, Average Sales, Average Rating, Item Visibility) for each outlet type (Supermarket Type 1, Supermarket Type 2, Grocery Store). This facilitates direct comparison and identification of top-performing outlet formats.

## Technical Details

* **Power BI:** The primary tool used for dashboard development, including data connection, transformation, visualization, and interactive features.
* **Excel:** Used for generating the simulated sales data, including creating realistic sales figures and trends.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating calculated measures and KPIs within Power BI, such as Total Sales, Average Sales, and other derived metrics.
* **Data Modeling:**  The data was modeled in Power BI to establish relationships between different tables (e.g., outlet information, item details, sales data) to enable effective analysis.

## Features

* **Simulated Real-time Sales Tracking:** Demonstrates how real-time data can be visualized.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilizes charts, graphs, and maps to present data in a clear and engaging way.
* **Drill-down Functionality:** Allows users to explore data at a granular level.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Tracks important metrics such as total sales, average order value, and top-selling products.
* **Sales Analysis:** Provides insights into sales by region and product category.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is simulated for demonstration purposes.  It was generated using Excel to represent realistic sales patterns and trends for a service like Blinkit.The data set and images used are given above can use them for the same effects .
